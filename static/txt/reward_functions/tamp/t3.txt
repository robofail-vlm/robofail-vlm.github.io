To account for the slight offset along the y direction when grasping the object, we can adjust the placement position accordingly. We will add an additional parameter to the `gen_plan` function to specify the y offset and use it to correct the placement position.

Here's the updated implementation:

```python
def gen_plan(initial: RavenBelief, grasp: RavenGrasp, y_offset: float):
    plan = []
    object_name = "object_0"  # The banana is identified as "object_0"
    plan.append(Action("pick", [object_name, grasp]))
    # Adjust the y position by the offset when placing the object
    adjusted_y = TABLE_CENTER[1] + y_offset
    plan.append(Action("place", [object_name, grasp, RavenPose(x=TABLE_CENTER[0], y=adjusted_y, z=0.02)]))
    return plan

def gen_domain(initial: RavenBelief):
    return {
        "grasp": GraspSampler(),
        "y_offset": ContinuousSampler(-0.05, 0.05)  # Allowing for a small offset range
    }
```

### Explanation:
1. **gen_plan Function**:
   - The function now takes an additional parameter `y_offset` to account for the slight offset along the y direction.
   - When placing the object, the y position is adjusted by adding the `y_offset` to the table center's y coordinate.

2. **gen_domain Function**:
   - The function returns a dictionary with two entries:
     - `grasp`: Sampled using the `GraspSampler`.
     - `y_offset`: Sampled using a `ContinuousSampler` with a range of -0.05 to 0.05, allowing for a small adjustment in the y direction.

### Why This Will Always Satisfy the Goal:
- The plan still explicitly picks up the banana and places it at the center of the table, but now with an adjustment for the y offset.
- The `y_offset` parameter allows for correcting the placement position to account for the slight offset during grasping.
- The table center coordinates are fixed and known, ensuring the banana is always moved to the correct location with the necessary adjustment.

This approach ensures that the goal is achieved regardless of the specific grasp sampled and the slight offset during grasping, as long as the offset is within the specified range.
